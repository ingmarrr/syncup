\section{Introduction}

Our concept revolves around a family/couple sharing application named "Syncup." 
This innovative app will facilitate users in sharing various essential aspects of their lives,
 including shopping lists, calendars, to-do lists, and expenses, among other features, which we'll delve into shortly.

"Syncup" derives its name from its core purpose: to synchronize daily activities and planning 
among users. While some of the features offered by our app may already exist individually 
on Google and Apple platforms, a common challenge lies in achieving seamless interoperability 
between these applications. Furthermore, these existing apps tend to focus on isolated functions, 
such as Google Calendar, whereas "Syncup" will consolidate all these individual features into a single,
 cross-platform application. This approach creates synergies between different aspects of users' lives, 
 allowing, for instance, the integration of shopping lists with expense tracking.

\section{Product Niche}
Our app is designed to stand out in a pool of many management apps. There two major platforms Google and Apple, 
both have management apps like GApps and Apples own applications which can be managed thought a family plan. The down side of these
platforms is for one apple apps do not work on google, and in order for user to use the GApps they have to download around a dozen or
so apps which in return multiplies the number of applications with the same functionality on their devices. Out app aims to 
reduce clutter of applications on ones device and have the same amount of functionality. Our application will also implement missing functionality
from other application to make it more intuitive and user friendly. In addition the application will be able
to connect to a bank account(for example: a shared one) and display statistic on monthly payments, in addition to this different budgets 
can also be created which will notify the users if the threshold is about to pass.

\section{Features \& Functionality}

\subsection{Features}

We will have different actors in our application, each with different features and functionality. The actors are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Group Member
    \item Group Admin
\end{itemize}

Depending on their level of authorization, users will have different rights and access to the application's features.
