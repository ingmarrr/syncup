\section{Introduction}

Our idea is a family/couple sharing app. This app will allow users to share common things
such as shopping lists, calendars, to-do lists, expenses etc. We will go further into the features
in a later section. The name of the application will be \emph{Syncup}, since it will help people
syncronise daily activities and planning. While individually some of the featues provided by this
app are already widly available on google and apple platforms, it can be quite a struggle to
have interoperability between those apps. Another downside is that they usually only focus on a 
single field, such as google calendar, whereas our application will combine all of those indiviual features
into a single app that is shared across platforms. This allows for great synergy between them and enables us
to combine things like shopping trips with your expense tracking.
